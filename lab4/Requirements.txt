# Description
In this lab, you will work in a ** team ** of four people. Since this is the case, the code given to you is extremely minimal. You will work together to control two motors using the L293D amplifier supplied in every kit. Using the potentiometer, the speed of the motors will be controlled.

# Instructions
First, you will need to be able to capture an analog voltage from a potentiometer that can swing from 5V to 0V.
The digital value captured from the potentiometer will control the duty cycle of several PWM signals that control the motors. These PWMs will be connected to the L293D amplifier and this amplifier will connect to either side of the motors.

You will use two motors. The motor is controlled by a difference in voltage between its two terminals. Therefore, to get it to spin forward at full speed, it is only necessary to apply a 5V signal to one side of the motor and 0V to the other side.

When the potentiometer is at its lowest point (~ 0V), only one motor will be on at full power. When the potentiometer is at its highest point (~ 5V), the other motor will be on at full power and the other one will be off. When the potentiometer is in the middle (~ 2.5V), both motors will be on at full power. This behavior emulates that of wheels turning in a car with the potentiometer being the steering wheel and the motors being the wheels.

You should be able to turn the entire system on and off by pressing a switch.


#Requirements
## Overall
1. Code must be readable and well commented.
2. Every file must contain code related to a single device. For example, the ADC and PWM code must be separated. The main function is an exception.
3. There are no non-trivial SFR manipulations in the main function and are wrapped in functions that have meaningful names
5. A state machine is used to implement the bulk of the functionality of the program

## ADC -- Jessica Sofka
1. A function exists to initialize the ADC
2. Uses the A0 pin as an input

## PWM -- Lena Voytek
1. Uses 2 PWMS on timer 3 and timer 4.
2. Has a changeDutyCycle function.

## Timer -- Jacob Bowles
1. Uses a timer (0 or 1) to debounce states

## Switch -- Nadine Alnajdawi
1. Uses a switch to turn motors on and off.
2. Switch uses an ISR
